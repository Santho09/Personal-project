# Text Summarization API

This project is a Flask-based web application that performs text summarization using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. It supports summarizing both plain text entered manually and text extracted from uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, and TXT).

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes long text by breaking it into chunks and applying a pre-trained summarization model.
- **File Support**: Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT files for summarization.
- **Manual Text Input**: Summarizes text directly entered into the API.
- **CORS Support**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled, allowing the API to be accessed by other applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Hugging Face's `transformers` library
- PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction
- python-docx for DOCX text extraction
- Flask-CORS for enabling cross-origin requests

## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization-api.git
   cd text-summarization-api
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
   
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
   
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` should include:

   ```
   flask
   flask-cors
   transformers
   PyPDF2
   python-docx
   ```

5. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/`
   - **Description**: Home route.
   - **Method**: `GET`
   - **Response**: Returns a welcome message.

### 2. `/summarize`
   - **Description**: Summarizes manually entered text.
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Request Body**: JSON with a `text` field containing the text to summarize.
   - **Response**: JSON containing the summarized text.
   
   #### Example Request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/summarize \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"text": "Your long text here."}'
   ```

   #### Example Response:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": "Summarized text."
   }
   ```

### 3. `/summarize-file`
   - **Description**: Summarizes text extracted from an uploaded file.
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Request Body**: A `multipart/form-data` request with the file (`pdf`, `docx`, or `txt`).
   - **Response**: JSON containing the summarized text.

   #### Example Request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/summarize-file \
   -F "file=@path_to_your_file.pdf"
   ```

   #### Example Response:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": "Summarized text from the file."
   }
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Manual Text Input**: Use the `/summarize` route to send long text as JSON and receive a summarized version.
2. **File Upload**: Upload a `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` file using the `/summarize-file` route, and the app will return a summarized version of the text.

## Handling Errors

The API handles the following error cases:

- If no file is provided in the request, the response will include an error message.
- If the uploaded file type is unsupported, the API will respond with an error.
- If the text is too long, the text will be split into chunks, and each chunk will be summarized.

## Development and Debugging

- To debug issues with file uploads, the app saves the uploaded file temporarily and prints the file path. Check the console output for debugging information.
- The `use_reloader=False` option in `app.run()` ensures the summarization model is not loaded multiple times.
